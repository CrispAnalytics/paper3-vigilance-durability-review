# S001 Gap Map (Draft)

- Generated (UTC): `2026-02-15T14:54:09.182281Z`
- Locked question: In low-baseline-arousal adults, which natural intervention protocols sustain elevated daytime tonic arousal and cognitive performance over repeated daily use, and which show habituation?

## Core Gaps (What Prevents Strong Claims About Sustained Tonic Arousal Engineering)

Population gaps:
- Trait-defined 'low baseline arousal' is rarely operationalized directly; most core-relevant work uses **structural or symptomatic proxies** (shift work disorder, chronic short sleep, post-injury fatigue).
- Limited stratified analyses testing whether low-arousal subgroups benefit more (or show different habituation) than higher-arousal subgroups.

Measurement gaps:
- Objective 'tonic arousal' markers (baseline pupil size/variability, continuous autonomic tone, EEG vigilance indices) are uncommon in field protocols; PVT is common but still a downstream proxy.
- Few studies align physiology + performance to support a mechanistic claim that baseline arousal is shifted (vs reduced sleep pressure, reduced circadian misalignment, or acute stimulation).

Durability/habituation gaps:
- Many repeated-use protocols report endpoints but do not test **within-protocol attenuation** (day 1 vs day 7 vs day 30) with enough resolution to call habituation vs stabilization.
- Where attenuation appears, it is often confounded with adaptation to the schedule or re-emergence of sleep restriction rather than a clean tolerance model.

Intervention gaps (natural, scalable, repeated-use):
- Underrepresented in the extracted evidence base: structured **breathing**, **cold exposure**, and **exercise** protocols explicitly designed to shift daytime arousal over repeated use in low-arousal adults with objective vigilance measures.
- Few studies test combined protocols as an optimization problem (e.g., light + sleep timing + caffeine timing) with factorial designs.

Design gaps:
- Blinding is often infeasible; strong designs therefore need robust counterbalancing, objective endpoints, and careful control of expectancy and carryover.
- Many studies are underpowered or have subset analyses for PVT; publication-quality conclusions require larger samples and preregistered primary outcomes.

## Highest-Leverage Next-Step Analyses (Secondary Research Only)

1. Build a durability-first taxonomy: classify each protocol by expected mechanism (sleep pressure reduction, circadian phase management, sensory stimulation, autonomic modulation) and map which mechanisms show evidence of attenuation.
2. Extract and compare protocol 'dose' parameters (light intensity/target, timing, adherence) and tie them to effect direction and durability windows.
3. Formalize a 'habituation' coding scheme usable across heterogeneous designs, then re-label the evidence in a transparent audit trail (can be done without new experiments).
