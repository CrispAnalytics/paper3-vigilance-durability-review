## Summary of What the Extracted Evidence Suggests

Across the core evidence base, repeated-use protocols that act via circadian and sleep regulation (light manipulation and sleep timing) show the most consistent objective vigilance improvements in low-arousal proxy populations. However, the evidence is heterogeneous and often limited by feasibility constraints (blinding, adherence, small samples) typical of real-world sleep/circadian interventions.

A critical interpretive distinction for this manuscript is whether an intervention plausibly shifts a 'tonic arousal set-point' versus reducing sleep pressure or circadian misalignment. In practice, most natural protocols likely improve daytime vigilance by changing upstream sleep/circadian state, not by directly elevating tonic arousal in a stimulant-like fashion.

## Habituation and Durability: How to Interpret Signals

Habituation signals in the extracted set most often appear as time-dependent effects across repeated exposures (e.g., strongest on early shifts, attenuation later) or reversal when the underlying constraint returns (e.g., weekend extension followed by recurrent weekday restriction). These patterns are consistent with state regulation rather than classical pharmacologic tolerance. By contrast, the caffeine context literature more directly illustrates tolerance/withdrawal dynamics that can compress net benefits over time.

## Practical Implications (Research, Not Clinical Guidance)

For repeated-use performance optimization in low-arousal proxies (shift workers, chronic short sleepers, fatigue populations), the most defensible evidence-driven framing is: (i) manipulate light and sleep timing to reduce misalignment and sleepiness, (ii) expect time-of-day and schedule interactions, and (iii) explicitly measure durability (day-by-day) rather than endpoint-only effects.

## Research Agenda Enabled by Secondary Research

This corpus supports a publishable durability-first taxonomy and a harmonized habituation coding framework. The highest-leverage next steps that do not require new experiments are: (1) protocol dose harmonization (timing, intensity, adherence), (2) explicit mapping of durability windows (day 1 vs day 7 vs day 30), and (3) separating proxy low-arousal populations from trait low-arousal claims.

## Limitations of This Evidence Base

- Proxy populations dominate; trait low baseline arousal is rarely defined explicitly.
- Few studies jointly measure physiology + performance strongly enough to claim a tonic baseline shift.
- Abstract-only extraction exists for at least one context item due to paywalled full text; these items are treated as context with reduced confidence.
