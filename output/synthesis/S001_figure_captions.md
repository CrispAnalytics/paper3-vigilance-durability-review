## Fig 1
Extracted works by primary intervention category, stratified by evidence tier (`T1_core` vs `T2_context`). Counts are unique works (not outcome rows).

## Fig 2
Vigilance durability map (work-level): x-axis is maximum repeated-use duration (days; log scale). y-axis is the work-level direction summary for vigilance endpoints. Points are colored by primary intervention category and shaped by tier; `T1_core` works are labeled by short_id. This plot is intended as an evidence map, not a meta-analysis.

## Fig 3
Risk of bias (overall) distribution by tier, using the per-work RoB summary recorded in `data/risk_of_bias.csv`. Missing/unclear ratings reflect incomplete reporting and/or abstract-only extraction for paywalled full texts.
