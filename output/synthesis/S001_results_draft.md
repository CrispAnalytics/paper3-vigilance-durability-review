## Study Characteristics (Extracted Set)

We extracted structured outcomes for 30 works ({'T2_context': 22, 'T1_core': 8}). The core evidence set (`T1_core`) comprises 8 works and primarily tests circadian/light and sleep-timing interventions in low-arousal proxy populations (shift work disorder, rotating shift workers, chronic short sleepers, and post-injury fatigue).
Across `T1_core`, repeated-use duration ranged from 3 to 60 days (max per work).

Core works by primary intervention category:
- `light`: 4 works
- `sleep_timing`: 2 works
- `multi`: 1 works
- `melatonin`: 1 works

## Core Findings by Intervention Class (T1_core)

### Light Manipulation

- `W1981621779` Tanaka 2011 (J Occup Health) (duration max=30.0d; RoB=some_concerns): Registered nurses (all female) working rapidly rotating shifts including night shifts..
- Vigilance `PVT mean RT (msec; 5-min)` (Day-shift afternoon break (~14:00-15:00), repeated measures; subset n=11): `improves`; Estimated mean RT: 264 ms (non-BL) vs 235.8 ms (BL); diff -28.2 ms (95% CI -46.2, -10.2), F(1,17.0)=11.0, p<0.01 (Table 4).
- Vigilance `PVT lapses (>500 ms)` (Day-shift afternoon break; subset n=11): `improves`; Estimated lapses: 2.03 (non-BL) vs 0.84 (BL); diff -1.19 (95% CI -1.98, -0.40), F(1,17.4)=10.0, p<0.01 (Table 4).

- `W2094064988` Boudreau 2013 (PLoS ONE) (duration max=7.0d; RoB=some_concerns): Same cohort..
- Vigilance `PVT median reaction speed (1/RT) (10-min), by time awake` (Post-night-shift lab visit (daytime sleep schedule), across wake period): `improves`; Median reaction speed: no main effect of adaptation group (p=0.88); main effect of visit (p=0.012); main effect of time awake (p=0.036); 3-way interaction (group×visit×time-awake) p=0.046. During visit 2, adapted group faster than non-adapted after 8–14h awake (p≤0.045).

- `W3180479501` Connolly 2021 (BMC Neurology) (duration max=60.0d; RoB=unclear): Community-dwelling adults with mild-severe TBI or stroke >=3 months prior, reporting significant fatigue..
- Vigilance `PVT mean RT (10-min)` (end of each 2-month condition (mixed model treatment effect estimate)): `improves`; Treatment effect estimate -28.36 ms (95% CI -47.48, -9.23), t=-2.91, d=-1.75, p=.004; n=18 for PVT.
- Vigilance `PVT fastest 10% RT (10-min)` (end of each 2-month condition (mixed model treatment effect estimate)): `improves`; Treatment effect estimate -15.10 ms (95% CI -25.03, -5.16), t=-2.98, d=-2.98, p=.003; n=18 for PVT.

- `W3200473843` Connolly 2021 (Frontiers Neurology; case studies) (duration max=60.0d; RoB=high): Same as above..
- Vigilance `PVT mean RT (ms)` (Case 2 only: baseline, mid/end treatment, mid/end control): `unclear`; Case 2 PVT mean RT (ms): 310.44 (baseline) -> 300.03 (mid T) -> 314.75 (end T) -> 288.65 (mid C) -> 268.51 (end C) (Table 2).

Across these core light studies, objective vigilance outcomes tended to improve at the endpoint of repeated-use protocols (weeks to months), but causal strength is limited by small sample sizes, partial blinding feasibility, and outcome subsets in some designs.

### Sleep Timing / Sleep Extension

- `W2128384646` Kubo 2011 (Scand J Work Environ Health) (duration max=3.0d; RoB=some_concerns; habituation_signal=yes): Daytime manufacturing employees with habitual short weekday sleep (mean weekday sleep ≤6h); neither extreme morning nor evening chronotype; no prescription meds; N=26 completers..
- Vigilance `PVT reaction time / reaction speed (10-min; PVT-192)` (Monday afternoon after the weekend (post-intervention vs post-control weekend)): `improves`; Significantly shorter reaction times on Mondays after the intervention vs habitual weekend sleep (p<0.05); overall condition×day interaction F(3,175)=6.01, p=0.001 (Figure 3; Table 1).
- Vigilance `PVT lapses (>500 ms) (10-min)` (Monday afternoon after the weekend): `improves`; Fewer PVT lapses on Mondays after intervention vs habitual weekend sleep (p<0.05); overall condition×day interaction F(3,175)=4.53, p=0.004 (Figure 3; Table 1).
- Vigilance `PVT reaction time / reaction speed (10-min)` (Thursday afternoon after the weekend): `worsens`; Significantly longer reaction times on Thursdays after intervention vs habitual weekend sleep (p<0.05), despite Monday improvement; condition×day interaction F(3,175)=6.01, p=0.001 (Figure 3; Table 1).
- Vigilance `PVT lapses (>500 ms) (10-min)` (Thursday afternoon after the weekend): `worsens`; Significantly more lapses on Thursdays after intervention vs habitual weekend sleep (p<0.05); condition×day interaction F(3,175)=4.53, p=0.004 (Figure 3; Table 1).

- `W4211135645` Cheng 2022 (Sleep) (duration max=7.0d; RoB=some_concerns; habituation_signal=yes): Night shift workers (>=20y) with ICSD-3 shift work disorder confirmed by interview + 2-week sleep log; pure 8h night shifts during study..
- Vigilance `Smartphone PVT reaction time (5-min) after night shift` (First night shift of each schedule (Table 2)): `improves`; First shift PVT RT: 0.67 s (morning sleep) vs 0.55 s (evening sleep), p=0.001; adjusted p=0.015 (Table 2). Lapses: 18.5 vs 15.4, p=0.009; adjusted p=0.115.
- Sleepiness `Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)` (After night shift (within 1h), by shift number (Table 2)): `improves`; KSS First shift: 4.9 (morning) vs 4.1 (evening), p=0.002; adjusted p=0.012. Second shift: 4.3 vs 4.0, adjusted p=0.097. Third shift: 5.1 vs 3.8, adjusted p=0.019. Fourth shift: ns (Table 2).

Across core sleep-timing/sleep-extension studies, benefits were often time-dependent (e.g., strongest on early shifts or early week) and could attenuate or reverse later, consistent with limited durability when the underlying schedule constraint persists.

### Melatonin (Natural Hormone)

- `W2165853793` Bjorvatn 2007 (Scand J Work Environ Health) (duration max=4.0d; RoB=some_concerns): Same cohort..
- Vigilance `Objective 5-min serial reaction-time test (Palm) at 3 timepoints during shifts` (Nights 1,3,6 and days 1,3,6): `unclear`; No significant differences in reaction times when averaged across night shift or day shift. Day shift showed condition×day interaction F(4,44)=4.1, p=0.025 (Table 1), driven by increased reaction times on day 1 after melatonin and bright light (narrative; Figure 4).
- Sleepiness `ATS: Fighting sleep (%) during day shift week` (Day-shift week (second week), averaged across week): `improves`; Day shift fighting sleep: placebo 3.4±3.5 vs melatonin 1.8±2.8; effect size vs placebo d=0.50; melatonin significantly lower than placebo (p=0.021) and bright light (p=0.022) (Table 3).
- Sleepiness `Quality of day rating (1 very good to 9 very bad) during day shift week` (Day-shift week (second week), averaged across week): `improves`; Quality of day (day shift): placebo 4.1±1.1 vs melatonin 3.4±0.6; effect size vs placebo d=0.79; melatonin significantly better than placebo (p=0.041) (Table 3).

In the extracted core melatonin evidence, subjective sleepiness and sleep outcomes improved modestly, while objective reaction-time measures showed limited consistent benefit in field conditions.

### Multicomponent Countermeasure Packages

- `W2158979070` Smith-Coggins 1997 (Acad Emerg Med) (duration max=30.0d; RoB=some_concerns): Attending emergency physicians working rotating shifts with night rotations..
- Vigilance `PVT (10-min): median RT and lapses` (multiple times during shifts; compared across conditions and across shift hours): `null`; PVT performance comparable regardless of intervention; neither experimental nor active placebo altered PVT (Fig 6). Median RT increased across the night shift when averaged across interventions (p=0.007).

In the extracted multicomponent core evidence, objective vigilance changes were limited, despite some subjective improvements reported in the underlying papers.

## Context Evidence for Habituation/Tolerance Framing (T2_context)

Context studies were extracted under a pre-specified cutoff emphasizing repeated-use duration and/or explicit habituation testing. These studies inform interpretation of durability mechanisms (e.g., stimulant tolerance/withdrawal; time-of-day and circadian interactions in light).
