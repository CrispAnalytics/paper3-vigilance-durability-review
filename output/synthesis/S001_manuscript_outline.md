## Working Title Candidates
- Durability of Natural Arousal-Enhancing Protocols in Low-Arousal Adults: A Systematic Review Focused on Habituation and Sustained Vigilance
- Engineering Daytime Tonic Arousal Without Drugs: What Repeated-Use Evidence Supports and Where It Breaks
- Repeated-Use Natural Interventions for Low Arousal: Evidence Map and Habituation-Aware Synthesis

## Research Question (Locked)
- In low-baseline-arousal adults, which natural intervention protocols sustain elevated daytime tonic arousal and cognitive performance over repeated daily use, and which show habituation?

## Abstract (Structured)
- Background: Why tonic arousal and sustained vigilance matter; why durability is understudied.
- Objective: Evaluate repeated-use natural intervention protocols in low-arousal adults, emphasizing sustained effects and habituation.
- Methods: PRISMA; OpenAlex-driven discovery + chaining; full-text retrieval constraints; manifest-driven screening; evidence extraction schema; RoB approach.
- Results: Number of core vs context studies; dominant intervention classes; durability patterns; habituation signals; RoB summary.
- Conclusions: What appears durable vs transient; key gaps; recommendations for next trials.

## Introduction (Key Moves)
- Define tonic arousal vs phasic arousal; why vigilance is a practical endpoint (PVT).
- Argue that 'does it work today' is not the relevant question; 'does it keep working with repeated use' is.
- Motivate why non-pharmacological approaches matter (safety, scalability, occupational relevance).

## Methods
- Protocol + PRISMA: `protocol/01_prisma_protocol.md`
- Search strategy log: `protocol/02_exact_search_strategy_log.md`
- Retrieval status + corpus reproducibility: `protocol/04_corpus_status_and_reproducibility.md`
- Full-text screening codebook: `protocol/06_fulltext_screening_codebook.md`
- Evidence schema: `protocol/07_evidence_extraction_schema.md`
- Cutoff/stopping rule for context extraction: `workflow/extraction/10_T2_context_cutoff_and_stopping_rule.md`

## Results (Suggested Structure)
- Study characteristics (core vs context; populations; settings; durations).
- Intervention classes:
  - Light manipulation (timing, spectral composition, intensity; workplace vs home).
  - Sleep timing / sleep extension (shift-work schedules; weekend extension).
  - Melatonin (as natural hormone; limited repeated-use data with objective vigilance).
  - Multicomponent packages (education + countermeasures).
  - Context-only: caffeine tolerance/withdrawal framing; confined environment; mechanistic physiology.
- Durability/habituation mapping (primary contribution): which protocols maintain vs attenuate and on what timescale.
- Risk of bias summary.

## Discussion (Suggested Structure)
- Summary of durable vs transient effects, interpreted mechanistically (sleep pressure vs circadian alignment vs sensory stimulation).
- Why habituation signals appear: adaptation, ceiling effects, diminishing marginal returns, adherence decay.
- Practical implications (occupational health framing) without prescribing clinical guidance.
- Limitations (proxy populations; heterogeneity; unblinded designs; abstract-only context item).
- Research agenda: a next-generation repeated-use trial architecture (counterbalanced, objective endpoints, physiology + performance, preregistered).
